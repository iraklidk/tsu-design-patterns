# Adapter Pattern
## Short Explanation
The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a middleman (an adapter) that translates one interface into another.   Itâ€™s useful when you want to make an existing class work with a new interface **without modifying the original class**, like connecting legacy code to modern code or bridging two systems with different APIs.
