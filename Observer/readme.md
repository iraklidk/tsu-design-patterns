# Observer Pattern
## Short Explanation
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects — when one object (the subject) changes, all its dependent objects (observers) are automatically notified and updated.
It’s useful when multiple parts of a program need to react to the same event or change — like UI updates when data changes, notifications when a value updates, or event systems in games.
