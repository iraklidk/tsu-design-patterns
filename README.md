# 🎨 Design Patterns in C#

This repository contains simple examples of common **Design Patterns**, implemented in C#.  
The goal is to provide **easy-to-understand, minimal code examples** that demonstrate the essence of each pattern.

## 📚 About
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design.  
They help developers write **cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code**.

This repo is my university learning project for the **"Design Patterns"** course.  
For each pattern, I’ll add:
- 📖 A short explanation
- 💻 A simple C# code example
- 🖼️ **Screenshots of the code + console output**
