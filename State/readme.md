# State Pattern
## Short Explanation
The State pattern allows an object to **change its behavior** when its internal state changes.  
It is useful when an object needs to **behave differently depending on its state**, like a music player (Playing, Paused), a TCP connection (Connected, Disconnected), or a document editor (Editing, ReadOnly).
