# Strategy Pattern
## Short Explanation
The Strategy pattern allows a class to **change its behavior at runtime** by using different interchangeable algorithms (strategies).  
It is useful when you want to **swap behaviors dynamically** without modifying the class, like switching between melee and ranged attacks.
